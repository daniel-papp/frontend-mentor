# Frontend Mentor - Intro Component with Signup Form
## Overview

In this challenge I created a landig page with a signup form. The page changes between one and two column layouts depending on screen size. The form uses simple HTML validation with Sass styling for visual aid and fill-out instructions. It also includes a small bit of JavaScript for checking empty fields.

### Built with

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- Sass
- JavaScript

### What I learnt

This project served as reinforcement for HTML forms and form styling. 

During the making I discovered the new *:user-valid* and *:user-invalid* CSS pseudo-classes. The JavaScript is only necessary for the validation styling and could be replaced entirely wiht these keywords. Unfortunately, as of right now they are only supported in Firefox so I decided against using them.

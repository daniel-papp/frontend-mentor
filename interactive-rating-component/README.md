### Built with

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- Sass
- JavaScript

### What I learnt

Even though this was a quiet simple project it was perfect for returning to programming after a short break. Two of the concepts I practiced during the making of the component were the **Javascript Module Pattern** and the *@use* and *@forward* **Sass** keywords.
